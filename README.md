# Comparative Study of ML Algorithms for Violence Classification
Repository for the Manthan Hackathon project

## Abstract
Violence Detection from video feeds is one of the important applications of
intelligent surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a classical machine learning pipeline
to detect violent activity in surveillance videos. The Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and
Histogram of optical flow (HOF) feature descriptors are extracted from the video and sent as
input to a number of tree-based classifiers. We also evaluate and compare the inference times of
models in order to study the models as worthy of being deployed in real-world situations by
converting them to intermediate representations in PyTorch using the hummingbird library. Our
study provides promising results in terms of usability and accuracy for real-time violence
surveillance scenarios
