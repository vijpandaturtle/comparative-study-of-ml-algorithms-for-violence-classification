# Event Detection Hawkeye - (CCTV event detection)
Repository for the Manthan Hackathon project

## Problem Statement 
Build a video analysis solution that is able to automatically search across CCTV footage for events such as knife attacks, chain snatchings and accidents, and give the exact timestamp of occurrence, frame number(s) and snapshot of frame(s) taken from the video where a match has been found. Please note that the same video could have multiple instances of events of the same or different type. It should also maximize accuracy of object classification, object detection and object tracking.
